🚀 Python-based Chat Assistant for SQLite Database  
🔗 Live API: [Chat Assistant API](https://chatassistant-production-2fb6.up.railway.app)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Flask-based **Chat Assistant** that interacts with an SQLite database to answer user queries. It accepts natural language input, converts it into SQL queries, fetches data, and responds in a clear, formatted manner.

## ✅ Features
✔ Accepts natural language queries.  
✔ Converts user input into SQL queries.  
✔ Retrieves relevant data from an SQLite database.  
✔ Handles invalid queries & errors gracefully.  
✔ Supports various queries, including:
- "Show me all employees in the [department] department."
- "Who is the manager of the [department] department?"
- "List all employees hired after [date]."
- "What is the total salary expense for the [department] department?"

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **SQLite** (Database management)
- **Flask** (Web API)
- **NLTK** (For natural language processing, if needed)
- **SQLAlchemy** (For database interaction)

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Subramanyabs15/Chat_Assistant.git
cd Chat_Assistant
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Prepare the SQLite Database
Ensure `employees.db` exists with this schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name TEXT NOT NULL,
    Department TEXT NOT NULL,
    Salary INTEGER NOT NULL,
    Hire_Date TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name TEXT NOT NULL,
    Manager TEXT NOT NULL
);
```
If missing, create it manually or use `create_db.py`.

### 5️⃣ Run the Assistant
```sh
python app.py
```
The API will be accessible at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
If using Railway, use your live URL:
```
https://chatassistant-production-2fb6.up.railway.app
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/`      | Returns "Chat Assistant API is running!" |
| POST   | `/chat`  | Accepts a user query and returns results |

## 📌 Example API Requests
### 📝 1️⃣ Using curl (Command Line)
```sh
curl -X POST "https://chatassistant-production-2fb6.up.railway.app/chat" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"query": "Who is the manager of the Sales department?"}'
```

### 📝 2️⃣ Using Postman
**Method:** POST  
**URL:** `https://chatassistant-production-2fb6.up.railway.app/chat`  
**Headers:** `{ "Content-Type": "application/json" }`  
**Body (JSON):**
```json
{
    "query": "Who is the manager of the Sales department?"
}
```

✅ **Expected Response:**
```json
{"response": [["Alice"]]}
```

## 🔍 How It Works
1. User enters a query in natural language.
2. Query gets converted into SQL using `query_parser.py`.
3. SQLite database fetches relevant data.
4. The response is formatted & returned in JSON.

## ⚠️ Error Handling
✔ Handles invalid department names (returns appropriate message).  
✔ Gracefully manages incorrect query formats.  
✔ Returns “No results found” for queries with no matching data.

## 🚀 Known Limitations & Future Improvements
🚧 **Limited NLP Support**: Complex sentence handling can be improved.  
🚧 **Enhancements Needed for Multi-Condition Queries**.  
🚧 **User Authentication**: Not yet implemented, could be a future feature.
